🧠 Student Burnout Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a student is at risk of mental burnout using behavioral data such as study hours, screen time, sleep patterns, and physical activity.

✨ Project Highlights  
- 📊 Built a dataset of 30 students with 5 behavior-based features  
- 🤖 Trained a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn  
- 🎯 Achieved 83.3% accuracy on the test set  
- 🔥 Visualized feature correlations using a heatmap  
- 📱 Entire project developed on Google Colab using a mobile device

📊 Results Overview  

| Metric     | Score |
|------------|-------|
| Accuracy   | 83.3% |
| Precision  | 0.83 (Non-Burnout), 0.00 (Burnout) |
| Recall     | 1.00 (Non-Burnout), 0.00 (Burnout) |
| F1-Score   | 0.91 (Non-Burnout), 0.00 (Burnout) |

⚠️ Note: The low performance on burnout cases is due to class imbalance in the test data. With more balanced data, the model's performance can improve significantly.
