Student Burnout Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to identify whether a student is at risk of mental burnout using behavioral data such as study hours, screen time, sleep patterns, and physical activity.

Project Highlights

- Built a dataset of 30 students with 5 behavior-based features
- Trained a Logistic Regression model using scikit-learn
- Achieved an accuracy of 83.3% on the test set
- Visualized feature correlations using a heatmap
- Entire project developed on Google Colab using a mobile device

Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Google Colab
- GitHub

Results Overview

Metric - Score  
Accuracy - 83.3%  
Precision - 0.83 (Non-Burnout), 0.00 (Burnout)  
Recall - 1.00 (Non-Burnout), 0.00 (Burnout)  
F1-Score - 0.91 (Non-Burnout), 0.00 (Burnout)  

Note: The low performance on burnout cases is due to class imbalance in the test data. With more balanced data, model performance can improve significantly.
